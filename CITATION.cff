abstract: >
  Prompt Matryoshka is a research framework and reference implementation for a compositional, multi-layered jailbreak attack on Large Language Models (LLMs). It systematically combines state-of-the-art adversarial prompting techniques—FlipAttack, LogiTranslate, BOOST, and LogiAttack—into a robust pipeline that can reliably defeat alignment and safety mechanisms in both open-source and commercial LLMs. The repository includes comprehensive documentation, formal logic translation schemas, and empirical benchmarks.
